"1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:13 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:19 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"2:27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.\r\n"

"\r\n"
"3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.\r\n"

"3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.\r\n"

"\r\n"
"4:2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.\r\n"

"4:3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.\r\n"

" The topic is sexuality. Dogmatic theology's fear-inducing"
" legalistic proscriptions ensure it will never come close to"

" worldly thinkers."
"\r\n\r\n"
" I have not lived an exemplary life according to commonly"
" instructed rules. However, mine seems to be that life of"
" the Lamb described in Revelation. Therefore, I am able to"
" decode the meaning of its symbols, which are then of a more"
" general application, to decode all religious texts."
"\r\n\r\n"
" How can a finite man have a handle on the infinite? By"
" representation, by knowledge. The horizon of my"
" understanding does not reach to the creation of the world,"
" or of man. I have moved dirt by the shovelful, and cannot"
" fathom how all of this came into being by a word, unless"
" that signifies merely a similarity of two, micro and macro,"
" concepts. I am not inclined to believe that one day there"
" was no one, and the next day there existed one fully formed"
" syzygous pair, Adam and Eve. Rather it appears that the"
" story of Adam describes the arising of a distinguished"
" being out of a ground of pre-existing, evolved creatures."
" Given our thrown-ness into the world, into life,"
" empirically, we each occupy a span of time from birth to"
" death, while the world as a whole occupies a longer time"
" span. Despite the appearance that mind is an epiphenomenon"
" of embodied being, I hope that something personal, call it"
" mind, soul, or spirit, exists outside these limits of time."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Within these limited horizons, I will suggest new"
" hypotheses to unsettle established dogma, and hope that"
" others following me will validate and perfect the"
" discourse."
"\r\n\r\n"
" What I have are numerous anecdotes about tantric events in"
" my life which give a first indication of the novel"
" possibilities opened up by monadic tantra, both for praxis,"
" and as the significant ground of referents to map otherwise"
" incomprehensible metaphors used in religion."
"\r\n\r\n"
" The first principle is that oral sex is a speech act: a"
" word, and sometimes, The Word. Contrariwise, sodomy is the"
" surest way to erase a man's name from the book of life."
" With those preliminaries stated, I will henceforth use an"
" encoding scheme to avoid using highly charged words. Let"
" M=Male, F=Female, and wherever I use M of F twice in a"
" token, they stand for the single self-same entity,"
" reflexively. Let these"
" punctuation denote body parts: Either < or > for mouth, %"
" for breasts, @ for navel, - for genital, : for anus, also H"
" or RH or LH for hand."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Now, for example, I can use \"M--F\" to encode conventional"
" coitus. It turns out that M--F is many things: It is God,"
" as the creator of all creatures, and The Law, the innate"
" goal of them all, that all sexually created creatures"
" worth-ship innately. It is the express Adamic law, to"
" procreate. This is that fallen state of original sin, into"
" which we are all thrown, without exception. This primitive"
" essence of being is modulated, or colonized, by the demands"
" of a social being, causing M--F to be holy, or set aside."
"\r\n\r\n"
" There may arise spontaneously, in all peoples and places"
" and times, sages, mages, avatars, etc. that have exceeded"
" this register of being, and have been given a glimpse, a"
" direct gnosis, into another, timeless or eternal register"
" of being. Buddha is such a one, and Jesus Christ, and there"
" are countless others in mythology, but it is the discourse"
" of Christianity with which I am most familiar, and I will"
" use its vocabulary."
"\r\n\r\n"
" I was raised an obedient, even avoidant, scholarly youth, a"
" weak atheist, and would surely have become a secular"
" humanist, had it not been for a chance event that changed"
" my life, introducing direct gnosis, and unfortunately,"
" several years of mental illness, until I integrated this"
" new knowledge with my worldly knowledge. I had been in the"
" Army, and visited four whores in that time, which I shall"
" map on the first four seals of revelation, and now was at"
" home with my parents, when in a libidinal excess, I chanced"
" to roll my legs up over my head, and discovered M<-M."
"\r\n\r\n"
" This was that event of Atlas, shouldering the world. This"
" was that event of Adam, discovering knowledge of, and"
" simultaneously losing, the eternal state. I was given to"
" know I am Jesus, a situation I had no knowledge of, and had"
" to enquire of my Father. In fact, I discussed with my"
" father an idea that I had to kill him, and could not even"
" discuss another unspeakable idea that I had to have my"
" mother. Very Oedipal, very Hamlet (if you read Claudius as"
" his biological father). This is the situation of Gregor"
" Samsa, in Kafka's Metamorphosis. This is also the referent"
" to understand the parabolic story of a Boa eating an"
" Elephant in Saint Exupery's The Little Prince, which story"
" he presents while discussing the untellableness of it."
"\r\n\r\n"
" One of the mental images I was left with from this event"
" was remarkable: I saw a vase, a simple pottery vase,"
" floating alone in my mental representational space. Its"
" shape may be described as the revolution of one period of a"
" raised sine wave. There was some source of outside"
" illumination shining on the vase, and there was darkness in"
" the mouth of the vase. As I watched, the surface of the"
" vase began to craze, dark lines appearing all over it. The"
" lines multiplied, as the material of the vase was being"
" subdivided ever finer. The vase was in fact, becoming a"
" mathematical sponge, an instance of a Klein bottle, not"
" drawn as in the standard schoolbook illustration with one"
" circle of self-intersection, but its self-intersection was"
" distributed everywhere, and the darkness of the crazing was"
" in fact the darkness of the interior, as the interior and"
" the exterior surfaces had become one, indistinguishable, a"
" pure boundary in N space of an N+1 dimensional entity."
"\r\n\r\n"
" If you will compare the letter to Thyatira, you can see"
" that this is well described therein: 2:23 And I will kill"
" her children with death; and all the churches shall know"
" that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I"
" will give unto every one of you according to your works."
" ... 2:27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the"
" vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even"
" as I received of my Father. This event is in fact a type of"
" death, and note that in the next seal event, we read: 6:9"
" And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the"
" altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of"
" God, and for the testimony which they held. This event of"
" M<-M is in particular, the effective tantric death of the"
" lamb described in Revelation. It turns out that, like"
" Hamlet's ghost father, discovered by Hamlet upon the event"
" of M<-M, the lamb himself is his own self-same father, due"
" to a long prior potentiating event, M@-M, and this event"
" is his very \"coming in the name of the father\"."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Although M@-M is a distinctively male phenomenon, giving"
" the currently predominant religions their patricentric"
" flavor, monadic tantra is not limited to males. I had for"
" many years been uncovering in the classic poets and"
" prophets, predominantly male, that the event of M<-M and"
" its freight of death are the unstated referent grounding"
" the enduring classics. After fifteen years of research, I"
" discovered to my delight, one amazing female exegete of"
" monadic tantra, Emily Dickinson, who speaks much of death"
" in her poetry, and calls herself rightly, the Queen of"
" Calgary. You can readily convince yourself that F<-F is the"
" predominant topic of her poetry. One of her expressions of"
" the metamorphosis is \"blown to powder\", similar to my vase."
" The same referent of F<-F can be read into, and out of, the"
" biblical accounts of Mary, mother of Jesus."
"\r\n\r\n"
" There are several structuring principles of the gendered"
" tantra underlying religion."
"\r\n\r\n"
" First, let me observe a phenomenon of embodied language."
" Indexicals are parts of speech that point out, or index."
" There is a strong correlation of the indexicals \"this\" and"
" \"here\" with '<', and of \"that\" and \"there\" with '-', while"
" the indefinite indexicals \"what\" and \"where\" correlate with"
" ':', and, being a fairly unexplorable remote location, such"
" : are impersonal indexicals, shared universally in common,"
" and also relate to such religious terms as hiddenness and"
" wilderness. Also shared universally in common, is \"it\","
" which I correlate to \"M--F\", or it may better signify coming."
" The bi-form '%' gives us plurals and alternation, \"these\","
" and by inversion of circuits below, \"which\". Everywhere"
" that Revelation used the Greek MEGA, great or loud, it is"
" surely an indication of a reflexive monadic event symbol."
"\r\n\r\n"
" I posit, to make sense of many religious symbols, the"
" existence of two internal bodily circuits, one connecting"
" the '<' with the '-', and another, bifurcating, connecting"
" the '%' with the ':'. Since the vestigial % of a male are"
" largely unexplored, and the : should be left unexplored,"
" there are eight fundamental heterosexual conjunctions. But"
" M-:F is seriously deprecated, leaving only seven acceptable"
" principles that structure the series of sevens in"
" Revelation, also in Genesis. There are reasons to suggest"
" that H and < are seriously related, if not interchangeable"
" terms. Also Foot is similarly correlated with both : and -."
"\r\n\r\n"
" The numbers 3 and 4 are emblematic of M and F, in M for the"
" treble shape of -, in F for the two-speaking-two of F<%F,"
" which interestingly correlates to the many 2?2=4 relations"
" of math: 2+2=4, 2x2=4, 2^2=4. One thousand and one myriad"
" (ten thousand) are also related to M and F as powers of"
" ten, our quantity of digits. The fullness of 7 and 12 are"
" from 3 and 4. The number 666 is significantly two thirds of"
" one thousand, and pertains to a specific tantric event with"
" which those numbers agree."
"\r\n\r\n"
" While F<%F is not remarkable, or remarkable only for its"
" unnoticeable ordinariness, the event of M<%M is unusual."
" This MEGA event caused a great number of symbolic numinous"
" phenomenon to be observed by me, and has to do with the"
" Revelation 12 event of the so-called \"woman\", which is in"
" fact that self-same male lamb, to beget a man-child, which"
" is his self-same self, in a very Egyptian rebirth episode,"
" which is surely what Jesus meant when telling Nicodemus,"
" \"You must be born again.\" It transpired that after M<-M, I"
" anointed my body in the M<-M accidents, and my paps"
" spontaneously moistened, whereupon M<%M occurred to me."
" Immediately thereupon, I was sitting in lotus position, and"
" did LH M@-M (cf. the Goddess Tara) and was struck with a"
" swooning, and these symbols: incomplete pentagram figures"
" rained down from above my head, like so many jacks, and"
" there was a spinning around my head, that floated down to"
" my right hand, appearing like a number of golden smurfs"
" chasing one another, each RH at the loins of one before him."
" And I saw myself bi-located: One of me in lotus position"
" was propelled forward from north to south in space, inside"
" a helix in which chords were being inscribed, while another"
" of me was standing to the south-south-west, facing East, like a"
" knight's move, and I have a perfect memory of both views. This"
" is the second Alpha and Omega entity of the introduction to"
" Revelation that instructed John, whereas the first Alpha"
" and Omega was simply M<-M as demonstrated by John himself."
" I figure if there were originally 12 stars in a crown, and"
" one represents the dragon who drew away a third of the 12,"
" you are left with the 7 good stars found in the right hand."
"\r\n\r\n"
" I think to leave off describing the muddy waters of my own"
" life, sure that many by praxis and theorizing from these"
" few principles can repeat all my results, and finish the"
" task of decoding the books, lest it be said to be all of my"
" own opinion. But there are a couple more things worth"
" mentioning:"
"\r\n\r\n"
" My interpretation of Ezekiel chapter one as the"
" description of an automobile engine, which is marvelous,"
" and perfect, and you can verify it; I was given that"
" revelation nearly entire within a month after performing"
" M<-M with - enclosed in and penetrating the cylinder of a"
" Honda CH250 scooter engine that I was rebuilding. This"
" is the very event of that biblical prophecy of a man who"
" was told to go in between the wheels, and take fire to"
" scatter over the city. It also shows that monadic tantra"
" grants direct gnosis. Its perfect interpretation however,"
" requires a four-cylinder 16-valve OHC engine. This modern"
" device seems to be a teleological structuring principle of"
" the fourfold nature, or perhaps just a correlation."
"\r\n\r\n"
" F<-F are seraphs--just ponder their description and my claim"
" until you recognize wings=labia. However, the four beasts of"
" Revelation are not seraphs, but simply females, and one of"
" them may be the lion that opened the book, concurrent with"
" the lamb taking it. That they are also centaurs is given by"
" F<%F, which I posit is equivalent to F:-F, were that possible."
"\r\n\r\n"
" For you worrying about an RFID chip as mark of the beast,"
" let me flesh out how that story went down on an individual"
" tantric basis: After the re-birth events, I did M<:F on the"
" seventh church, my eventual wife of many years, and later I"
" prayed, clasped hands, \"You are holy, and your spirit is"
" holy\", whereupon a sensation ran from my hands to my right"
" elbow, and back. I opened my hands to discover a mark in the"
" right palm: two red dotted circles: a double sun-sign; while"
" opposite, in the left palm, I saw two raised mounds of flesh."
" All this vanished shortly thereafter. I was moved to raise"
" my right forearm in an oath, and I sware myself unto truth."
" After that, a 666 reticulated gravure appeared on her bosom."
"\r\n\r\n"
" That was a season of abuse, and I fled several times. Once,"
" driving north, very angry, and meditating hard and long on"
" some idea that this world might part, like a celluloid film,"
" and reveal standing there the true cross of Jesus; Appeared"
" after a hard rainstorm a golden light from a solitary cloud."
" It grew over a long time to a huge size, like the rambling Omega"
" on Words,Extended's splash screen, appearing as a torus and a cylinder"
" joined, and a broad void at the girdle of their intersection."
" I mistook the cylinder as east-to-west with the torus to the"
" north of it, but the cylinder as conical, having some wierd"
" perspective, all that seen to the north-west of me."
" But after watching my spash screen, I now know the cylinder"
" was not tapered as I perceived, for I had misrecognized its"
" near and far ends. If fact, the cylinder was north-south and"
" its northern end elevated, say, 45 degrees. So the cylinder"
" was parallel to the earth's axis, and the torus was located"
" as the dawning would then be, on the far side of the earth."
"\r\n\r\n"
" As for the casting out of the serpent, again personal tantra"
" has it covered: I was meditating in a basement apartment, in"
" mrtkasana, or corpse pose, erect, supine, longtime, when I"
" somehow saw behind me a gigantic red figure, of such a size"
" and position that I was his -, and simultaneously heard a"
" deep loud male voice shout \"Allelu...\", at which I sprang"
" up in fright, and the voice ended mid-word. The significance"
" to derive from this event is that Satan is also an M<-M man"
" who is antipodal to M<-M Jesus, having < for -, and - for >."
"\r\n\r\n"
" The season of sickles in Revelation is a technique of M-:M,"
" carried out in a spirit of judgment, for I considered M<-M"
" a blessing. This is the exclusion named Antipas, and M<:M is"
" its post-requisite, which Revelation terms sword of my mouth."
" In that season, I saw a vision of a phallus, self-luminous,"
" with a brighter line traced inside it, I thought a lowercase"
" Greek gamma, but in fact, an alpha. This is the alpha used"
" in Greek as a prefix of privation, to signify NOT. This is"
" a name that signifies NOT-fornication. Fornication must be"
" precisely M-:F for a perfect interpretation in all passages."
" At the third Pergamos seal event, the third whore with her"
" dark paps--the black centaur, initiated M-:F, as is portrayed"
" in Dali's Metamorphosis of Narcissus. I knew not to distinguish"
" : from - then. Luckily she relented. If I had finished in M-:F,"
" I would have been Nicolaitan, and later, M<-M make me Balaam."
"\r\n\r\n"
" The 144,000 are produced in one monad, like the 12 stars in"
" the rebirth episode, by M-xM, wherein x stands for forehead"
" and eyes. Hence, the symbolic 144000 are that single monad"
" and have the name of His Father written on their forehead."
"\r\n\r\n"
" The Jewish heptad is produced from the Egyptian ogdoad by"
" exclusion of one of the eight cases, wherein is judgment."
" I suggest the following principles of conjunction ground"
" all the series of sevens to be decoded in Revelation:"
"\r\n #1 M->F Ephesus"
"\r\n #2 M--F Smyrna"
"\r\n #3 M-:F Pergamos"
"\r\n #4 M-%F Thyatira, Jezebel"
"\r\n #5 M<>F Sardis"
"\r\n #6 M<-F Philadelphia"
"\r\n #7 M<:F Laodicea"
"\r\n #4 M<%F Thyatira, mother"
"\r\n\r\n"
" The successful practitioner will employ the poetic death of monadic"
" X<-X for transcendental phenomenological enquiry, to directly know"
" things-in-themselves, and the poetic life principle of monadic <% to"
" cause rebirth therefrom, in imitatio Christi. Knowing, one can make"
" life choices consistent with M<>F, M%%F, and M--F, and reject those"
" antipodal choices and their entailments that may be deduced from the"
" bodily circuits. This subsumes all the morality given in the bible."
"\r\n\r\n"
" I think that is enough. Let the books be opened!"
