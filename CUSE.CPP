" 2. Otherwise, you would be viewing a source text, and then the following rules apply:"
"\r\n\r\n"
" If a token resembles a URL, either right or left-clicking on that"
" URL token will invoke the Add, One Internet Page dialog, pasting that"
" URL into the dialog, ready to download that one Internet resource."
" If it is a binary resource, you will be asked to save it to a file."
" If it is an HTML or plain text resource, it will be prepared for"
" reading in Words,Extended. If it is a single web page (not multiple URLs"
" downloaded for a frameset), that source text will become the new"
" current view automatically, just as if you had clicked the Add, One"
" Internet Page thread result view's single result summary item."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Left-clicking on any word will invoke the Add, Word Search"
" dialog, pasting that word into the dialog, ready to begin a"
" search for that word locally, within all the source texts"
" held in memory. The dialog checkbox \"[x] Stem\" option finds"
" all words in memory that have the same word stem as your search"
" word(s). Multiple search words may be entered in the text box."
" Each word is searched individually, and the results commingled."
" There are three Add, Word Search display options: The (o) KWIC"
" (KeyWord-in-Context) format will find and show all occurrences"
" of the search words, while the (o) Sentences or (o) Paragraphs"
" formats only report such matching words as occur in portions"
" of source texts that were determined to be rich in sentences."
" After left-clicking a word to start a word search, click on"
" any match-text item shown in the word search results view to"
" begin reading a source text with that matching text segment"
" positioned at the top of the window. While reading a source"
" text, use either delete or escape to remove the source text"
" and return to the previous view of Add, Word Search results."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Right-clicking on any word will invoke the Add, Internet search"
" dialog, pasting that word into the dialog, ready to begin a web"
" search for that word. Many search engines will be queried and"
" both query result web pages, and very many hit-result web pages"
" that they have reported will be downloaded into memory. You"
" may either click on some of the interesting downloaded web page"
" items as they appear and are summarized, or use other Words,Extended"
" features like Add, Word Search, or Add, Best Sentences, to"
" drill into the growing corpus of source texts held in memory."
" After right-clicking a word to start an Internet Search, click"
" on any web page summary item shown in the Internet search results"
" view to begin reading a source text. While reading a source"

" Whenever Words,Extended downloads or inputs a source text, which might be"
" either an HTML or plain text, Words,Extended catalogs all canonicalizable"
" URLs found in anchors and various other tags, and also any tokens"
" in clear text that are recognizable as URLs. Although you cannot"
" choose to browse any particular anchor in Words,Extended (Save the page"
" as a .HTM file, and re-open it with Internet Explorer to do that),"
" you can download all of the URLs found in a source text by using"
" Add, All Links on Page. This command also makes possible to use"
" Words,Extended to download a list of URLs that you have first added to"
" a plain text file, which file you open using the menu command File, Open"
" Page from File, and then use the menu command Add, All Links on Page."
" The command Add, All Links on Page starts downloading immediately,"
" without first opening a user dialog, but it obeys the last setting"
" of the \"[x] Non-text too\" checkbox that was set in the dialog for the"
" menu command Add, One Internet Page."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Occasionally, on some computers, when downloading certain URLs,"
" program calls from Words,Extended to the synchronous Windows Internet"
" library functions will not ever return to the Words,Extended program."
" The symptom of this error is that a thread performing an HTTP"
" download will cease from showing new results every few seconds,"
" neither does it show \"Thread Ended\". If it ever happens, you"
" will not be able to exit the Words,Extended program, because a Words,Extended"
" close operation waits for all threads to stop before destroying"
" shared memory objects; and that hung thread cannot be stopped."
" If this error ever happens to you, you might first save all the"
" downloaded files into a directory, and then right-click on the"
" Windows taskbar to invoke the Windows Task Manager program, and"
" use Task Manager to terminate the Words,Extended program. If this"
" ever happens, you should run the Windows Update and install all"
" available optional updates. That fixed it for me on Windows XP."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Words,Extended does not process JavaScript. If ever a web page"
" does not appear to have all the expected text, use the"
" control+i key to invoke Internet Explorer passing the"
" URL of the current view, as it may better parse the web"
" page. After Internet Explorer opens the page, you can copy"
" all, and paste the text back into Words,Extended to read. Words,Extended"
" parses all HTML source down to unadorned Unicode text with"
" included HTML link tags. Such pages when saved to files may"
" be reopened using Internet Explorer to see and follow the"
" links. Otherwise, when using Words,Extended, you do not browse by"
" following links, but by making queries to search engines"
" and then working with the large corpus of harvested texts."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Words,Extended contains information for many search engines, some"
" in foreign languages. To reduce the list of search engines"
" to be queried, use File, Save Search Engines to output the"
" default list of search engines, and manually edit out such"
" lines as you do not wish. Then use File, Load Search Engines"
" to open your file, which list will replace the current list"
" of search engines used by Words,Extended. If you copy the revised"
#ifdef _WIN32_WCE
" file to the fixed location \\My Documents\\WordsEx\\Engines.txt, then"
#else // not _WIN32_WCE
" file to the fixed location C:\\WordsEx\\Engines.txt, then"
#endif // _WIN32_WCE
" Words,Extended will always import your revised list whenever"
" Words,Extended starts up."
"\r\n\r\n"
" In some world locations, or as search engines change and in case I"
" never update Words,Extended from version 1.0, or to use new search"
" engines that I did not happen to list, you will need to know how"
" to tailor the engines.txt list."
"\r\n\r\n"
" If you wish to add new search engines you might use Words,Extended itself"
" to begin the task of studying the search engine. Use the menu command"
" Add, One Internet Page to fetch the URL of a search engine portal page,"
" that is, a web page that contains a search submission form, and a submit button."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Then with that fetched portal page still in memory, do File, Save Search"
" Engines. The saved Engines.txt output file will also include a section"
" of information about"
" all the HTML forms that Words,Extended has encountered and parsed."
" Since Words,Extended does not parse JavaScript, if the web page form"
" is written using JavaScript, you will have to manually analyze the form"
" source code yourself."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Some lines starting with the keyword FYI 000 show specimens of all the"
" query submission URLs that have been constructed from the forms parsed."
" If you change FYI to GET, and 000 to a three-digit ordinal controlling"
" the order to query the engines and used to label their results; such lines"
" become syntactically suitable specifications of search engine query URLs"
" to control the Add, Internet Search operation after the Engines.txt file"
" has been reloaded using the menu command File, Load Search Engines."
" You may need to examine alternatives for some parameters that are listed"
" after the URL specimens, and modify the URL to get the effects you want."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Before running that new URL, append another text line after that GET line"
" saying STUDY. Next, do File, Load Search Engines, and load your new file."
" Then use Words,Extended to perform an Internet search controlled by that"
" loaded two-line Engines.txt file, and save all the downloaded files to a"
" folder. Query result pages will have filenames starting with an"
" underscore, and due to the STUDY keyword, the query result page"
" will be heavily annotated with potential page scraping observations."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Manually edit the query result page, and use the final section of"
" annotations therein caused by STUDY to select page-scraping rules,"
" following the examples of rules in the default search engine list."
"\r\n\r\n"
" All of the valid engine.txt rule lines that can follow a GET line must"
" start with one of the following expressions:"
"\r\n\r\n"
"  good url has ..."
"\r\n\r\n"
"  bad url has ..."
"\r\n\r\n"
"  more url has ..."
"\r\n\r\n"

"  none good after ..."
"\r\n\r\n"
"  keep ... (keep query result page as a good web page for reading.)"
"\r\n\r\n"
"  study ... (studying engine - annotate facts in query result page.)"
"\r\n\r\n"
" For example, one of the interesting engines that I chose not"
" to keep in the Words,Extended default list used four rules:"
"\r\n\r\n"
"GET 150 http://www.reference.com/search?db=web&q=\r\n"
"  none good until TWO TOKENS \"Search\" \"took\"\r\n"
"  good url has next TAG /td\r\n"
"  more url has anchortext NUMBER\r\n"
"  none good after anchortext NUMBER"
"\r\n\r\n"
" Any bad-url rules placed ahead of good-url rules can override them."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Another interesting query url that I chose not to keep demonstrates"
" the keep keyword, as the query result page is itself a good text:"
"\r\n\r\n"
"GET 100 http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&q=define:\r\n"
"  good url has prior TAG li\r\n"
"  keep query result page as a good web page for reading"
"\r\n\r\n"
" Another Internet searching control mechanism is still present, but I"
" have not used it any more, after adding strong page scraping rules:"
" Lines in Engines.txt beginning with a NOT keyword and followed by two double-quoted"
" strings tell what URLs should never be fetched as hit URLs, neither after"
" a redirection. The first string must match the end after some dot of"
" the domain part of the URL of the query result page, and the second string must"
" be found (as by C routine strstr) in the potential web page hit URL to fetch."
" If both string tests match, then that potential hit URL will be rejected."
" If the first string is #, it matches a numeric IP address as the query"
" result page domain. If the first string is *, it matches any query"
" result domain. If the first string is /, it means the second string"
" will be tested only against path-less URLs (i.e., top domain names)."
"\r\n\r\n"
" Words,Extended holds all data in memory, and can quickly use up"
" all of Windows virtual memory. To recover from malloc failures"
" would require much more programming, so instead, Words,Extended"
" will warn you and stop fetching any more web pages once it has"
" consumed 500 Megabytes. If your virtual memory is set larger"
" than 1 Gigabyte, you should still be able to save your pages."
" If very full, do File, Save All Pages before doing File, Save"

"Interpretation: Ezekiel chapter 1 describes a 20-th century "
"automobile engine in the closest terms available to Ezekiel: "
"\r\n\r\n"
"The word 'whirlwind' describes a rotating, and gaseous process. "
"What the KJV translates as a 'fire enfolding itself' is better "
"translated in NIV as a 'fire continually sparking'. For 'living "
"creature' think not of biologically alive, but of mechanically live "
"assemblies. One piston atop a connecting rod resembles a man's shape. "
"Its 'four faces' means the four-cycle engine phases. Its 'four wings' "
"means the four fluttering, wing-shaped rockers on a single overhead cam. "
"The engine valves located below each rocker resemble arms and 'hands', "
"like the palm of a hand can cover an orifice. Ezekiel's expression "
"'ran and returned as a flash of lightning' means that the piston and "
"rod assemblies reciprocate synchronously with each spark. Ezekiel's "
"'one wheel upon the earth' means the one crankshaft that is mounted "
"in the relatively immobile, hence earthlike, engine block. "
"Each 'wheel in a wheel' means one circular piston mounted upon that "
"crankshaft. As Ezekiel describes, each piston-wheel 'goes on its side "
"and turns not'. Ezekiel's 'rings' are indeed engine rings. Their many "
"'eyes', i.e., many holes, are found in the engine oil-control ring. "
"Ezekiel's 'firmament' means the engine head, which is over the heads "
"of the living creatures. What Ezekiel called a 'terrible crystal "
"above the firmament' means the overhead cam-shaft. The 'voice from "
"the firmament' means the action of fuel-injection. Ezekiel's 'throne' "
"and 'seated' whence issue 'lightning' mean the distributor and rotor. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"This long, complex resemblance goes beyond a chance resemblance, and "
"beyond wrestling with subtle word interpretations. It is unmistakable "
"and undeniable, and a sign that biblical prophecies apply to our day. "
"This should excite you to research such topics. Next read Yom Teruah. "

"My witness to Yom Teruah."
"\r\n\r\n"
"The Lord said, 'I need a witness to Yom Teruah.'"
"\r\n\r\n"
"I offered myself."
"\r\n\r\n"
"Yom Teruah basically means a day of noise, or blasts. A trumpet, teruah, "
"also heralds war. I posit that the epochal Yom Teruah event has already "
"happened; that it was the Sept 11 2001 attack on the World Trade Center."
"\r\n\r\n"
"Yom Teruah, The Day of Trumpets, also known as Rosh ha Shanah, heralds "
"the final messianic revelation and redemption to come at the end of days."
"\r\n\r\n"
"Recently, in early 2007, I had several dreams."
"\r\n\r\n"
"The most singular and prominant dream gave a big spiritual announcement, "
"loud, from heaven, saying: 'I need a witness to Yom Teruah.' And "
"I offered myself in a feeble sort of way, citing how much "
"I didn't know about the topic, but I would like to do it. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"And I dreamt I was lying supine in a low place, like a valley, "
"or even smaller, perhaps a bowl-like crater, and I saw several "
"men pulling a small two-wheeled cart forward, pulling it up "
"on a gradual incline that surrounded the valley or depression, "
"pulling that cart all the way up to high place on the rim "
"of the valley or depression in which I lay. "
"After that, I saw two immense figures that now appeared to be "
"standing side by side on the high rim of this crater. Both figures "
"were dark, obviously evil, and very tall. One figure had a prominent "
"crown, like a king's crown, in the form of a circle with a large "
"number of spikes standing upward and slightly outward above upon the "
"circle. And his heart (or chest area) was extremely black. The other "
"figure standing next to him had no crown, and I figured that this "
"second figure was a queen corresponding to that king. I saw that "
"her mouth was also outlined in extreme blackness, probably meaning "
"that she blasphemes. However there were no visible gender clues, and "
"I remembered later that on a cheap chess set, it's the queen that has "
"the prominent crown such as I saw, and it's the king that has a plain top. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Later, I recognized that this dream might relate to a biblical end-time "
"topic known as 'the valley of decision'."
"\r\n\r\n"
"But I dismissed the call as past business, because the two figures reminded "
"me of the two WTC towers, which some New Yorkers called the king and queen, "
"and the men with the cart that I saw, I presumed had built them. It happens "
"that on the morning of 9-11-2001, even far earlier than 6 AM in California, "
"I was already up early and surfing the web for biblical and eschatological "
"topics. At about 6 AM, I saw four men's faces flash before me, one of which "
"had a small squarish beard. The fourth face differed from the first three, "
"because the fourth face faded away very fast from my memory. Each face had "
"a single prominent horn atop the crown of its head, each horn being shaped "
"like the front of an airplane fuselage. Much later, after having seen and "
"heard about the WTC events as they unfolded, I understood this vision to "
"represent some four of the terrorists as if 'merged with' four airplanes. "
"So beginning on that day and for several weeks after, I was posting to many "
"Internet forums that the WTC attack fulfilled many biblical prophecies. "
"(I still believe that.) So that had seemed to be my witness, already past. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"In another dream, I was being wheeled through many corridors, "
"some of which were open, like parking garages. I was reclining "
"on a dolly like a delivery man might use, like a trash can dolly. "
"I recall something to do with water. Either I was all wet, or else "
"there was water dripping, or else water was all around on the ground. "
"I was immobile on the dolly, and did not look around to see who might "
"have been pushing me about on the dolly. I went thus through quite "
"a few corridors and ramps, various areas and onto different levels. "
"I observed that many of the concrete walls were chipped into, which "
"thing I called 'structural damage' when first reporting this dream, "
"although I do not think that I had yet become aware of, nor watched, "
"any of the much '911 Evidence' that is on the web and uses that very "
"expression, structural damage, quite a bit. "
"At one point, I was wheeled past a group of about twenty assorted men, "
"sitting around on seats in one of the open areas, appearing as if they "
"were on break from work, or perhaps planning their next work, and they "
"seemed like structural engineers and construction workers, and one "
"of them asked another one, 'What time is it?' After the second one "
"answered, 'Eleven-thirty,' the first one interpreted the response, "
"saying, 'So, that's eight-thirty.'"
"\r\n\r\n"
"Then, I was wheeled out of that building, up a small knoll. "
"As I looked out to my right, there was a large building "
"on fire, with much smoke coming up from it. It was domed, "
"and I though it might be a huge church, or it could be a "
"government building. Then to the left of that, another "
"building just exploded, sending much stuff straight up "
"into the sky. And then right in front of me, the building "
"I had been wheeled through, which appeared now to be only one "
"story high, but all the top of it was made of strong concrete "
"framing holding great horizontal glass windows, as if it were "
"the top of some big greenhouse, and the building spanned a vast "
"distance and breadth horizontally; That same vast short building "
"all collapsed at once. It occurred to me sometime later that the "
"vast horizontal expanse that I perceived as the top of a building "
"was similar in appearance of an outside vertical wall of the WTC. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"So with those dreams as impetus, let me review what I know."
"\r\n\r\n"
"On that morning of 2001-09-11, I had been up some hours surfing the web "
"for novel insights into biblical, especially apocalytic, interpretation. "
"At about 6 AM California time, four male faces flashed briefly before me, "
"one after the other: Two were nondescript, a third bearded in the style "
"of Marwan Al-Shehhi, and the fourth faded too quickly to be remembered. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Each man had what appeared to be a single horn, about 4 cm diameter "
"and 20 cm long, protruding straight up out of the crown of his head, "
"slightly tapered and rounded at the tip, an outline I now recognize as "
"symbolizing the front of an airplane fuselage. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"About a year prior, I had read Dante Aligheri's 'Divine Comedy' avidly, in "
"one sitting, and I was impressed that in Divine Comedy was the first time "
"that I had ever read or heard any good suggestion how ten horns might be "
"disposed upon seven heads, as is the case said for a beast in Revelation. "
"Dante wrote it thus, in the second section, Purgatorio, in Canto 32: "
"\r\n\r\n"
"'Transfigured thus the holy edifice "
"\r\n  Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it, "
"\r\n  Three on the pole and one at either corner. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"'The first were horned like oxen; but the four "
"\r\n  Had but a single horn upon the forehead; "
"\r\n  A monster such had never yet been seen!' "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Hours later, when news came on TV about the World Trade Center attacks, "
"I knew what it meant, at least in general form. I joined many prophecy "
"forums and began to share correlations of this event to prophecies in "
"scriptures and in other texts, and diligently sought more information. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"It's not like I was unprepared for it. My life had been changed years "
"earlier to be all about solving Revelation, the meaning of Apocalypse. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"In the summer of 1976 I lost a day of my life. That is, I lost all "
"memory of what happened one night, probably because psychiatric "
"drugs administered for an acute psychosis prevented the permanent "
"reorganization of short term memories into long term memories. Or "
"perhaps what I suddenly knew was too dreadful to even think upon. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"I recall a cloud of darkness of some kind entering into my bedroom "
"in the late evening, and by morning, I was talking crazy to my dad. "
"For example, I told him I thought a big candle on the coffee table "
"was a bomb.--If I were to light it, the whole world would blow up! "
"By mid-day, I was not even able to speak at all. I kept shaking two "
"stones violently together in my right hand to make a warning, as if "
"what I suddenly had learned and somehow had to communicate was not "
"speakable. Or maybe, in fact, it was something 'unlawful' to speak, "
"to quote Paul. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"One mental image I remember was of an urn or vase sort of floating "
"alone in a representational space. In the mouth of it was darkness. "
"A soft light shone upon it from the upper right. Spontaneously the "
"vessel began to craze. The crazing of it became finer and thorough "
"throughout the whole surface and body of the vessel. Destruction "
"was integral to, and in fact the very essence of the vessel itself. "
"I reckon it as a mathematical sponge, or an N+1 dimensional Klein "
"bottle whose self-intersection was not as in the usual schoolbook "
"illustration, but evenly distributed everywhere through the vessel. "
"Meanwhile, in my existential crisis, I tried to become 'smaller' to "
"escape divine inspection and wrath, like a pebble that could think, "
"having to stop its atoms from even vibrating to get ever smaller, "
"a grain, powder, vanishingly small. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"About catatonic by the time my parents drove me to the psychiatric "
"crisis center, I accepted their meds, and laid down to be totally "
"engaged with a sunbeam that was coming through a gap in the blinds. "
"Although I could not move my body, my insides felt like they were "
"violently trembling from fear. Every heart beat scared me like the "
"tick of a timer poised to blow up, and destroy existence itself. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"I just recently realized the extreme coherence of that symbology of "
"the entire universe exploding (not like expanding, but like ceasing "
"to exist), and of my heart being the ticking timer of the final bomb "
"that would end the world. If you're up on philosophy, on the unusual "
"notion that what appears in the mind, phenomena, cannot be rigorously, "
"by some logic, related to their equivalent noumena out in the world; "
"And despite Descartes' 'Cogito', a mind must be embodied to receive "
"sensations from the world; So then, the existential dread that I felt "
"was in fact the awareness of the 'possibility of the impossibility of "
"being' as Heidegger calls death, of a mind that would be cut off from "
"the body by its mortal passing, hence of a mind that could be cut off "
"from the entire world, a fore-knowledge or fore-taste of death itself, "
"like Paul says Jesus tasted."
"\r\n\r\n"
"Why did I say all that? In subsequent years of mental illness, I "
"occasionally would be overcome by dread when hearing a helicopter "
"flying overhead, fearing that one of its blades would fall off, "
"and exactly so as to strike and behead me. This is an essential "
"archaic symbol. I had never even seen the movie, 'The Exorcist'. "
"This was prior to seriously hearing of and accepting Jesus Christ. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Once, I entered a severe dread state and had to be hospitalized, "
"just from seeing a cartoon in an electronics magazine in which a "
"ham radio operator is saying, 'Come in, x8296', while a jet plane "
"with that call sign is poised above and about to strike his house. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"I said all that to say, I have been groomed to be ready to recognize "
"the sign of the end-time: the abomination of desolation, or, rather, "
"the desolating abomination, as was foretold in the Book of Revelation. "
"The 9/11/2001 WTC destruction is surely that very prophesied sign. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Consider how many predictions within a short apocalyptic piece "
"in Zephaniah 1:14-17 correlate perfectly with the physical facts "
"surrounding 9/11: "
"\r\n\r\n"
"The great day of the LORD is near, "
"it is near, and hasteth greatly, "
"even the voice of the day of the LORD: "
"the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. "
"That day is a day of wrath, "
"a day of trouble and distress, "
"a day of wasteness and desolation, "
"a day of darkness and gloominess, "
"a day of clouds and thick darkness, "
"A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, "
"AND AGAINST THE HIGH TOWERS. "
"And I will bring distress upon men, "
"that they shall walk like blind men, "
"because they have sinned against the LORD: "
"and their blood shall be poured out as dust, "
"and their flesh as the dung. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"But that event was not the end. 9/11 was only the nearly-end warning. "
"There must yet be some chance of a repentance, a choice of salvation, "
"because Zephaniah 2:1-3 next says:"
"\r\n\r\n"
"Gather yourselves together, yea, "
"gather together, O nation not desired; "
"Before the decree bring forth, "
"before the day pass as the chaff, "
"before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, "
"before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you. "
"Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, "
"which have wrought his judgment; "
"seek righteousness, seek meekness: "
"it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"In fact, I can tell you just how long you have, and I will shortly..."
"\r\n\r\n"
"Has the superbly blessed America become a nation not desired? "
"\r\n\r\n"
"It has. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"I paid NO attention to 9/11 conspiracy theories until recently "
"when I watched one, then another web video presentation of the "
"analysis of the WTC collapse, and sought more evidence already "
"building and much published on the web, which all demonstrates "
"clearly that all three WTC towers collapsed from a pre-planned "
"controlled explosive building demolition technique, making 9/11 "
"a heinous self-inflicted wound, a 'false flag' deception used "
"to initiate an unjustified, and imperialist, war. But how else "
"do I know? "
"\r\n\r\n"
"The testimony comes by the Holy Spirit, and out of prophecies. "
"\r\n\r\n"
"Look first at a 9/11 prophecy from Dante's Divine Comedy, a "
"few hundred lines from Project Gutenberg's free online text. "
"In a story told as Dante's personal bodily and spiritual journey "
"down through inferno, up through a purgatory, and then into "
"paradise, but also being a time sequence, and thus mappable onto "
"historical time, Dante has visions that I instantly recognized as "
"correlated to the 9/11 WTC strikes and falling, but now they hold "
"even more new meanings that I could not have guessed until hearing "
"the '911 Evidence' of the 9/11 false-flags conspiracy theories. "
"Dante is explicitly told to report certain facts that he himself "
"does not understand, for our future benefit. I challenge you "
"to solve the final number of the riddle, and tell me it too! "
"\r\n\r\n"
"To pinion your understanding with what I recognize easily, "
"a griffen-drawn chariot is an airplane, as Ezekiel 1 was "
"clearly an automobile engine, and Ezekiel spoke of another "
"which he then recognized as the same, here the similar but "
"not quite the same thing means jet engines. At 'thunder was "
"heard, and its forward progress interdicted', it struck the "
"first tower, and was stopped in mid-air. At the line about "
"'the bird of Jove' describes when the second airplane struck "
"the second tower, and at that point the fox jumps in, for a "
"controlled demolition would seem plausible, and a foreign "
"plot finished as a government plan. The harlot imagery is "
"one set of standard Revelation interpretations of America "
"as Babylon. Why, you can tear into that part of Revelation "
"if I point out that a furlong is a linear measure, and 1600 "
"is a perfect square. So if you take the square root BEFORE "
"converting it to miles, you have 25 square miles, the area "
"of Manhattan island. Now enjoy Tennyson's translation, and "
"please try to make perfect my merely partial interpretation. "

"\r\n  Whoever turns the helm to come to port )"
"\r\n"
"\r\nMotionless halted, the veracious people,"
"\r\n  That came at first between it and the Griffin,"
"\r\n  Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,"
"\r\n  Singing, \"Veni, sponsa, de Libano\""
"\r\n  Shouted three times, and all the others after."
"\r\n"
"\r\nEven as the Blessed at the final summons"
"\r\n  Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,"
"\r\n  Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nSo upon that celestial chariot"
"\r\n  A hundred rose 'ad vocem tanti senis,'"
"\r\n  Ministers and messengers of life eternal."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThey all were saying, \"Benedictus qui venis,\""
"\r\n  And, scattering flowers above and round about,"
"\r\n  \"Manibus o date lilia plenis.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nEre now have I beheld, as day began,"
"\r\n  The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,"
"\r\n  And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd the sun's face, uprising, overshadowed"
"\r\n  So that by tempering influence of vapours"
"\r\n  For a long interval the eye sustained it;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nThus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers"
"\r\n  Which from those hands angelical ascended,"
"\r\n  And downward fell again inside and out,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nOver her snow-white veil with olive cinct"
"\r\n  Appeared a lady under a green mantle,"
"\r\n  Vested in colour of the living flame."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd my own spirit, that already now"
"\r\n  So long a time had been, that in her presence"
"\r\n  Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nWithout more knowledge having by mine eyes,"
"\r\n  Through occult virtue that from her proceeded"
"\r\n  Of ancient love the mighty influence felt."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs soon as on my vision smote the power"
"\r\n  Sublime, that had already pierced me through"
"\r\n  Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nTo the left hand I turned with that reliance"
"\r\n  With which the little child runs to his mother,"
"\r\n  When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nTo say unto Virgilius: \"Not a drachm"
"\r\n  Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;"
"\r\n  I know the traces of the ancient flame.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut us Virgilius of himself deprived"
"\r\n  Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,"
"\r\n  Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:"
"\r\n"
"\r\nNor whatsoever lost the ancient mother"
"\r\n  Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,"
"\r\n  That weeping they should not again be darkened."
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"Dante, because Virgilius has departed"
"\r\n  Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;"
"\r\n  For by another sword thou need'st must weep.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nE'en as an admiral, who on poop and prow"
"\r\n  Comes to behold the people that are working"
"\r\n  In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nUpon the left hand border of the car,"
"\r\n  When at the sound I turned of my own name,"
"\r\n  Which of necessity is here recorded,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nI saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared"
"\r\n  Veiled underneath the angelic festival,"
"\r\n  Direct her eyes to me across the river."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAlthough the veil, that from her head descended,"
"\r\n  Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,"
"\r\n  Did not permit her to appear distinctly,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nIn attitude still royally majestic"
"\r\n  Continued she, like unto one who speaks,"
"\r\n  And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:"
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice!"
"\r\n  How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?"
"\r\n  Didst thou not know that man is happy here?\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nMine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,"
"\r\n  But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,"
"\r\n  So great a shame did weigh my forehead down."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs to the son the mother seems superb,"
"\r\n  So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter"
"\r\n  Tasteth the savour of severe compassion."
"\r\n"
"\r\nSilent became she, and the Angels sang"
"\r\n  Suddenly, \"In te, Domine, speravi:\""
"\r\n  But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass."
"\r\n"
"\r\nEven as the snow among the living rafters"
"\r\n  Upon the back of Italy congeals,"
"\r\n  Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd then, dissolving, trickles through itself"
"\r\n  Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes,"
"\r\n  So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nE'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,"
"\r\n  Before the song of those who sing for ever"
"\r\n  After the music of the eternal spheres."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut when I heard in their sweet melodies"
"\r\n  Compassion for me, more than had they said,"
"\r\n  \"O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nThe ice, that was about my heart congealed,"
"\r\n  To air and water changed, and in my anguish"
"\r\n  Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast."
"\r\n"
"\r\nShe, on the right-hand border of the car"
"\r\n  Still firmly standing, to those holy beings"
"\r\n  Thus her discourse directed afterwards:"
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,"
"\r\n  So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you"
"\r\n  One step the ages make upon their path;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nTherefore my answer is with greater care,"
"\r\n  That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,"
"\r\n  So that the sin and dole be of one measure."
"\r\n"
"\r\nNot only by the work of those great wheels,"
"\r\n  That destine every seed unto some end,"
"\r\n  According as the stars are in conjunction,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut by the largess of celestial graces,"
"\r\n  Which have such lofty vapours for their rain"
"\r\n  That near to them our sight approaches not,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nSuch had this man become in his new life"
"\r\n  Potentially, that every righteous habit"
"\r\n  Would have made admirable proof in him;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut so much more malignant and more savage"
"\r\n  Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,"
"\r\n  The more good earthly vigour it possesses."
"\r\n"
"\r\nSome time did I sustain him with my look;"
"\r\n  Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,"
"\r\n  I led him with me turned in the right way."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs soon as ever of my second age"
"\r\n  I was upon the threshold and changed life,"
"\r\n  Himself from me he took and gave to others."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhen from the flesh to spirit I ascended,"
"\r\n  And beauty and virtue were in me increased,"
"\r\n  I was to him less dear and less delightful;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd into ways untrue he turned his steps,"
"\r\n  Pursuing the false images of good,"
"\r\n  That never any promises fulfil;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nNor prayer for inspiration me availed,"
"\r\n  By means of which in dreams and otherwise"
"\r\n  I called him back, so little did he heed them."
"\r\n"
"\r\nSo low he fell, that all appliances"
"\r\n  For his salvation were already short,"
"\r\n  Save showing him the people of perdition."
"\r\n"
"\r\nFor this I visited the gates of death,"
"\r\n  And unto him, who so far up has led him,"
"\r\n  My intercessions were with weeping borne."
"\r\n"
"\r\nGod's lofty fiat would be violated,"
"\r\n  If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands"
"\r\n  Should tasted be, withouten any scot"
"\r\n"
"\r\nOf penitence, that gushes forth in tears.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"\r\nPurgatorio: Canto XXXI"
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,\""
"\r\n  Turning to me the point of her discourse,"
"\r\n  That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nShe recommenced, continuing without pause,"
"\r\n  \"Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,"
"\r\n  Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nMy faculties were in so great confusion,"
"\r\n  That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct"
"\r\n  Than by its organs it was set at large."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAwhile she waited; then she said: \"What thinkest?"
"\r\n  Answer me; for the mournful memories"
"\r\n  In thee not yet are by the waters injured.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nConfusion and dismay together mingled"
"\r\n  Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight"
"\r\n  Was needful to the understanding of it."
"\r\n"
"\r\nEven as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged"
"\r\n  Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,"
"\r\n  And with less force the arrow hits the mark,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nSo I gave way beneath that heavy burden,"
"\r\n  Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,"
"\r\n  And the voice flagged upon its passage forth."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhence she to me: \"In those desires of mine"
"\r\n  Which led thee to the loving of that good,"
"\r\n  Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhat trenches lying traverse or what chains"
"\r\n  Didst thou discover, that of passing onward"
"\r\n  Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd what allurements or what vantages"
"\r\n  Upon the forehead of the others showed,"
"\r\n  That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nAfter the heaving of a bitter sigh,"
"\r\n  Hardly had I the voice to make response,"
"\r\n  And with fatigue my lips did fashion it."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWeeping I said: \"The things that present were"
"\r\n  With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,"
"\r\n  Soon as your countenance concealed itself.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd she: \"Shouldst thou be silent, or deny"
"\r\n  What thou confessest, not less manifest"
"\r\n  Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth"
"\r\n  The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal"
"\r\n  Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame"
"\r\n  For thy transgression, and another time"
"\r\n  Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nCast down the seed of weeping and attend;"
"\r\n  So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way"
"\r\n  My buried flesh should have directed thee."
"\r\n"
"\r\nNever to thee presented art or nature"
"\r\n  Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein"
"\r\n  I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee"
"\r\n  By reason of my death, what mortal thing"
"\r\n  Should then have drawn thee into its desire?"
"\r\n"
"\r\nThou oughtest verily at the first shaft"
"\r\n  Of things fallacious to have risen up"
"\r\n  To follow me, who was no longer such."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward"
"\r\n  To wait for further blows, or little girl,"
"\r\n  Or other vanity of such brief use."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThe callow birdlet waits for two or three,"
"\r\n  But to the eyes of those already fledged,"
"\r\n  In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nEven as children silent in their shame"
"\r\n  Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,"
"\r\n  And conscious of their fault, and penitent;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nSo was I standing; and she said: \"If thou"
"\r\n  In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard"
"\r\n  And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nWith less resistance is a robust holm"
"\r\n  Uprooted, either by a native wind"
"\r\n  Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nThan I upraised at her command my chin;"
"\r\n  And when she by the beard the face demanded,"
"\r\n  Well I perceived the venom of her meaning."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd as my countenance was lifted up,"
"\r\n  Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful"
"\r\n  Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd, still but little reassured, mine eyes"
"\r\n  Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,"
"\r\n  That is one person only in two natures."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBeneath her veil, beyond the margent green,"
"\r\n  She seemed to me far more her ancient self"
"\r\n  To excel, than others here, when she was here."
"\r\n"
"\r\nSo pricked me then the thorn of penitence,"
"\r\n  That of all other things the one which turned me"
"\r\n  Most to its love became the most my foe."
"\r\n"
"\r\nSuch self-conviction stung me at the heart"
"\r\n  O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became"
"\r\n  She knoweth who had furnished me the cause."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThen, when the heart restored my outward sense,"
"\r\n  The lady I had found alone, above me"
"\r\n  I saw, and she was saying, \"Hold me, hold me.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nUp to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,"
"\r\n  And, dragging me behind her, she was moving"
"\r\n  Upon the water lightly as a shuttle."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhen I was near unto the blessed shore,"
"\r\n  \"Asperges me,\" I heard so sweetly sung,"
"\r\n  Remember it I cannot, much less write it."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThe beautiful lady opened wide her arms,"
"\r\n  Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,"
"\r\n  Where I was forced to swallow of the water."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThen forth she drew me, and all dripping brought"
"\r\n  Into the dance of the four beautiful,"
"\r\n  And each one with her arm did cover me."
"\r\n"
"\r\n'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;"
"\r\n  Ere Beatrice descended to the world,"
"\r\n  We as her handmaids were appointed her."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWe'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant"
"\r\n  Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine"
"\r\n  The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'"
"\r\n"
"\r\nThus singing they began; and afterwards"
"\r\n  Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,"
"\r\n  Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us."
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,\" they said;"
"\r\n  \"Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,"
"\r\n  Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nA thousand longings, hotter than the flame,"
"\r\n  Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,"
"\r\n  That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs in a glass the sun, not otherwise"
"\r\n  Within them was the twofold monster shining,"
"\r\n  Now with the one, now with the other nature."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThink, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,"
"\r\n  When I beheld the thing itself stand still,"
"\r\n  And in its image it transformed itself."
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhile with amazement filled and jubilant,"
"\r\n  My soul was tasting of the food, that while"
"\r\n  It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nThemselves revealing of the highest rank"
"\r\n  In bearing, did the other three advance,"
"\r\n  Singing to their angelic saraband."
"\r\n"
"\r\n\"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,\""
"\r\n  Such was their song, \"unto thy faithful one,"
"\r\n  Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps."
"\r\n"
"\r\nIn grace do us the grace that thou unveil"
"\r\n  Thy face to him, so that he may discern"
"\r\n  The second beauty which thou dost conceal.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nO splendour of the living light eternal!"
"\r\n  Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus"
"\r\n  Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nHe would not seem to have his mind encumbered"
"\r\n  Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,"
"\r\n  Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nWhen in the open air thou didst unveil?"

"\r\n  I say the less in reference to the greater"
"\r\n  Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nI saw upon its right wing wheeled about"
"\r\n  The glorious host returning with the sun"
"\r\n  And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs underneath its shields, to save itself,"

"\r\n"
"\r\nThat soldiery of the celestial kingdom"

"\r\n  Before the chariot had turned its pole."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThen to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,"
"\r\n  And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,"
"\r\n  But so that not a feather of him fluttered."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThe lady fair who drew me through the ford"
"\r\n  Followed with Statius and myself the wheel"

"\r\n"
"\r\nSo passing through the lofty forest, vacant"

"\r\n"
"\r\nIts tresses, which so much the more dilate"

"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd turning to the pole which he had dragged,"
"\r\n  He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,"
"\r\n  And what was of it unto it left bound."
"\r\n"
"\r\nIn the same manner as our trees ( when downward"
"\r\n  Falls the great light, with that together mingled"
"\r\n  Which after the celestial Lasca shines )"
"\r\n"
"\r\nBegin to swell, and then renew themselves,"
"\r\n  Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun"
"\r\n  Harness his steeds beneath another star:"
"\r\n"
"\r\nLess than of rose and more than violet"
"\r\n  A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree"
"\r\n  That had erewhile its boughs so desolate."
"\r\n"
"\r\nI never heard, nor here below is sung,"
"\r\n  The hymn which afterward that people sang,"
"\r\n  Nor did I bear the melody throughout."
"\r\n"
"\r\nHad I the power to paint how fell asleep"
"\r\n  Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,"
"\r\n  Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nEven as a painter who from model paints"

"\r\n  And say a splendour rent from me the veil"
"\r\n  Of slumber, and a calling: \"Rise, what dost thou?\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs to behold the apple-tree in blossom"
"\r\n  Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,"
"\r\n  And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,"

"\r\n  Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,"
"\r\n  Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nThus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet"
"\r\n  Of her commandments all devoted was,"
"\r\n  My mind and eyes directed where she willed."
"\r\n"
"\r\nNever descended with so swift a motion"
"\r\n  Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining"
"\r\n  From out the region which is most remote,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAs I beheld the bird of Jove descend"
"\r\n  Down through the tree, rending away the bark,"
"\r\n  As well as blossoms and the foliage new,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd he with all his might the chariot smote,"
"\r\n  Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest"
"\r\n  Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThereafter saw I leap into the body"
"\r\n  Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,"
"\r\n  That seemed unfed with any wholesome food."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut for his hideous sins upbraiding him,"
"\r\n  My Lady put him to as swift a flight"
"\r\n  As such a fleshless skeleton could bear."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThen by the way that it before had come,"
"\r\n  Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle"
"\r\n  Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes."
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd such as issues from a heart that mourns,"
"\r\n  A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:"
"\r\n  \"My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!\""
"\r\n"
"\r\nMethought, then, that the earth did yawn between"
"\r\n  Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,"
"\r\n  Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nAnd as a wasp that draweth back its sting,"
"\r\n  Drawing unto himself his tail malign,"
"\r\n  Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThat which remained behind, even as with grass"
"\r\n  A fertile region, with the feathers, offered"
"\r\n  Perhaps with pure intention and benign,"
"\r\n"
"\r\nReclothed itself, and with them were reclothed"
"\r\n  The pole and both the wheels so speedily,"

"\r\n"
"\r\nFirm as a rock upon a mountain high,"

"\r\n  A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,"

"\r\n"
"\r\nBut because she her wanton, roving eye"
"\r\n  Turned upon me, her angry paramour"
"\r\n  Did scourge her from her head unto her feet."
"\r\n"
"\r\nThen full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,"

"\r\n  The maidens in the midst of tears began;"

"\r\nAnd Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,"
"\r\n  Listened to them with such a countenance,"
"\r\n  That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross."
"\r\n"
"\r\nBut when the other virgins place had given"
"\r\n  For her to speak, uprisen to her feet"
"\r\n  With colour as of fire, she made response:"

"\r\n"
"\r\nAs soon as I was with her as I should be,"
"\r\n  She said to me: \"Why, brother, dost thou not"

"\r\n"
"\r\nAs unto those who are too reverential,"
"\r\n  Speaking in presence of superiors,"
"\r\n  Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,"

"South, or upper (towards the source of the Nile). While the southern "
"kingdom, depending on the flooding Nile for crop fertility, worshipped "
"fertility gods, the northern kingdom was the seat of solar worship. "
"The former are more matriarchal (with Isis/Ceres, the cereal goddess, "

"of desert plateau, mountain peaks, meadows full of Indian paintbrush and "
"wild primrose, some unexpected river two steps off the trail--then released "
"back into the twenty-knot push into the uncreated. He was not sure what it "

"Nor as it turned out was S.S. Stupendica all she seemed. She had another "
"name, a secret name, which would be made known to the world at the "
"proper hour, a secret identity, latent in her present configuration, though "
"invisible to the average passenger. What she would turn out to be, in fact, was a "
"participant in the future European war at sea which everyone was confident "
"would come. Some liners, after 1914, would be converted to troop carriers, "
"others to hospital ships. The Stupendica's destiny was to reassume her latent "
"identity as the battleship S.M.S. Emperor Maximilian--one of several 25,000-ton "
"dreadnoughts contemplated by Austrian naval planning but, so far as official "
"history goes, never built. The Slavonian steamship line that currently "
"owned and operated her seemed mysteriously to have sprung, overnight, "
"from nowhere. Even identifying its board of directors offered occasion for "
"lively displute in ministries throughout Europe. In shipping circles, nobody "
"had heard of any of them. British naval intelligence was flummoxed. Though "
"her boilers appeared to be of the Schultz-Thorneycroft design favored by "
"Austria-Hungary, the engines were modified cousins of the same Parsons "
"turbines to be found these days among the more sizable British men-o'-war, "
"capable of twenty-five knots and more, should the occasion demand, for as "
"long as the coal supply lasted. "
